(B) 2015-07-07 Add stats command (informing me about DB size)
(C) 2015-07-07 Make a relabel command?
(C) 2015-06-20 Make tests work [tried to get cram running on Windows but it wouldn't; raised issue w/ them; now waiting]
(C) 2015-06-26 ini should only output default parts of the ini not the parts the user has added (as seen when I still had old config settings after upgrading)
(C) 2015-07-06 add command for config editing
(C) 2015-07-01 edit must catch the case when sheet doesn't exist (currently shutil copy just errors out)
(C) 2015-06-24 make sure colorama {{https://pypi.python.org/pypi/colorama}} is initialized properly; test demo on Windows; allow bold only mode (bright in colorama, see demo)
(C) 2015-06-30 use gitpython for backing up sheet instead of copying all the time {{http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1456269/python-git-module-experiences}}
(C) 2015-06-24 let ppl disable color codes
(C) 2015-06-23 make --version work
(C) 2015-06-23 Write a temporary now line to hledger file s.t. ongoing task is reflected? (might be trouble later when adjusting to ledger file entirely; maybe write a temp file that is included from main file via ledger syntax)
(C) 2015-06-20 Adjust README
(C) 2015-06-22 Adjust requirements in setup.py
(C) 2015-06-20 Add conda environment for Windows development (test whether it is usable with fresh environment)
(D) 2015-06-30 consider re-activating ti's editor backup via temp file
(D) 2015-06-20 Adjust usage help
(D) 2015-06-20 Publish to pypi 
(D) 2015-06-20 Publish on web site
x (A) 2015-06-24 make finish output a time (and add duration too!)
x (A) 2015-06-23 make ini writing and checking (output current config?) easy
x (A) 2015-06-23 specify working dir instead of sheetname => move hledger output over as well
x (A) 2015-06-22 Add config option for alternative usage folder (want to share over seafile) [can now move sheet to whereever]
x (B) 2015-06-26 add parsing experimentation functionality
x (B) 2015-06-26 "at 9:26" times are treated as if they are in UTC messing up my calculations [fixed w/ pytz and tzlocal]
x (B) 2015-06-24 make times "at 12:23" work for switching [parsedatetime seems to be a tremendous library]
x (B) 2015-06-24 tim hl1 etc should allow additional parameters to be curried, e.g., for filtering
x (B) 2015-06-20 Simplify code further (delele unneeded)
x (B) 2015-06-23 remove fuzzy output (or make crisper; I hate seeing about an hour all the time in status)

x (D) 2015-06-24 add editor config
